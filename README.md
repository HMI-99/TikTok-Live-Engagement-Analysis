TikTok Live engagement tracking and Python data analysis project.
# TikTok Live Engagement Analysis üìä

Welcome to my TikTok Live Engagement Analysis project! This repository contains both my raw Excel dataset tracking TikTok Live metrics, and the Python analysis notebook with visualizations that explore audience growth and engagement trends.

## üìÅ Project Overview

This project started as a manual tracking effort in Excel, recording key engagement metrics from my study-focused TikTok Lives throughout April to June 2025. The goal was to better understand patterns in views, likes, comments, and overall engagement, so I could optimize my content and timing.

To deepen the analysis, I transitioned to Python, using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization. This allowed me to automate growth calculations, visualize trends over time, and tell a clearer story with my data.

## üß† Data Journey & Learnings

I began by cleaning and exploring my data in Excel with pivot tables and conditional formatting, which helped identify engagement levels and weekly trends.

Then, I used Python and Jupyter notebooks to:  
- Load and clean the data using pandas  
- Calculate week-over-week percentage growth  
- Visualize views, engagement scores, and cumulative views over time with matplotlib  
- Document my thought process with markdown cells for clear storytelling

Key challenges included file management and ensuring data was sorted chronologically for accurate growth calculations. Overcoming these built my confidence in managing data pipelines.

## Key Insights and Summary of Findings üìà

- TikTok Live views showed a **steady increase of approximately 15,000 total views** over 12 weeks, with weekly views peaking at over **4,400 views** in week 23.  
- Week-over-week **percentage growth in views fluctuated widely**, with spikes reaching up to **482% growth** in some weeks, indicating rapid bursts of audience interest.  
- Engagement scores (combining likes, comments, shares relative to views) reached highs of over **2,800% in some weeks**, demonstrating strong interaction during key livestreams.  
- The cumulative views steadily rose, surpassing **3 million total views** by the end of the tracked period, showing consistent channel growth.  
- Periods of slower growth or dips in engagement helped identify opportunities for content adjustment and strategy refinement.  
- Combining Excel pivot tables and Python visualizations enabled a detailed, dynamic view of performance trends and actionable insights for optimizing live content.
